# nerv 🧠⚡

A fast, efficient Brainfuck compiler in C

Nerv is an optimizing toolchain for interacting with Brainfuck programs. It includes an Interpreter, Visualizer, and Brainfuck to C compiler.

## TODO
> More complex loop unrolling

> Possibly write an API

> Build Visualizer

## Why bother with optimizations?
Brainfuck is a heinously innefficient language, and is rather easy to optimize.

## examples
examples is a directory containing lots of fun Brainfuck programs. A subfolder of examples, benchmarks, stores some intensive programs used to benchmark the interpreter and compiler.
