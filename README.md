# nerv

A fast, efficient Brainfuck compiler in C

Nerv is an optimizing toolchain for interacting with Brainfuck programs. It includes an Interpreter, Visualizer, and Brainfuck to C compiler.

## TODO
> Optimize the Brainfuck to C compiler's File IO (ie: less fprintf calls)

> More complex loop unrolling

> Possibly write an API

> Add optimization flags

## Why bother with optimizations?
Brainfuck is a heinously innefficient language, and is rather easy to optimize.
